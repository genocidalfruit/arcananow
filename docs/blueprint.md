## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7), evocative of mystery and the occult.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#212121), providing a stark contrast to the card images and other UI elements, ensuring they stand out. Also, deep purple (#212121) mixed with a 15% desaturation is similar to black.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D1C4E9) used sparingly for interactive elements like buttons or to highlight the card interpretation sections.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata' (serif) to communicate a sense of tradition.
- Use simple, elegant line icons related to tarot symbolism (e.g., stars, moons, swords, cups) for navigation and other interactive elements.
- Arrange the three cards in a classic spread layout (e.g., Past, Present, Future).  Ensure the layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- Implement subtle animations for card flipping and shuffling to enhance user engagement. Keep animations smooth and short.
